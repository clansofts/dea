# Double Entry Accounting

Double entry accounting is a systematic approach that ensures every financial transaction is recorded in at least two accounts. An account represent a bucket or basket that holds value. Value here means balances or money in other words.

This system follows the principle of duality, which states that every transaction has equal and opposite effects on at least two accounts, meaning that value flows from a source account to a destination account. This ensures that the accounting equation

    Assets = Liabilities + Equity

remains in balance. It must be noted the above equation can be expanded to accommodate the Revenues , Expenses and Drawings. Equity is derived from

    Equity = Common Stocks + Paid Up Capital + Retained Earning).

    Retained Earnings = Revenues â€” Expenses.

Therefore rewriting the equations as

    Assets = Liabilities + ((Common Stocks + Paid Up Capital) +(Revenues â€” Expenses) â€” Drawings))

Traditionally an account is usually represented in a T format meaning it got two sides left (Debit â€” DR) and right (Credit â€” CR).
